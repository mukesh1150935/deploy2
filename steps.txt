There are four sub-steps required to run experiments:
1. Preprocessing
2. Word alignments extraction
3. Phrase embeddings extraction
4. Training/evaluation



1. cloning mosesdecoder 
    git clone https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder
    ./scripts/preprocess.sh data de en ./mosesdecoder


2. Install fastalign 
    git clone https://github.com/clab/fast_align.git
    cd fast_align
    mkdir build
    cmake build
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
    This should generate the fast_align.exe and atools.exe files in the build directory.
    ./scripts/get_align.sh data de en ./fast_align


3. Phrase embeddings
    pip install torch-2.0.1 torchdata-0.6.1 torchtext-0.15.2
    run main file in src folder 

4. Training
    run train file

5. Testing and evaluation
    run test file 
    candidate and references are generated and erase EOS UNK BOS from them
    and run bleu_score.py
